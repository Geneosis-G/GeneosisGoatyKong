[quote=About this mod]That was a nice little mod that was suggested on the request thread, or maybe a combination of multiple suggestions :)
The central idea was the rolling barrels, so that's what I started making first. I didn't know if adding a constant spin to an object would be enough to keep it rolling, but it turned out that it was working just fine ^^ I had to make a few adjustments to actually stop the barrels at some point or they would just roll forever X)
Then I had another idea in mind since I added that mod to the planned list and it was to add an easter egg to have a rocket-powered barrel on your back that you can use the same way as the steerable jetpack ;) That's why I added explosives barrels too, so that it makes a bit more sense :p So I took inspiration from both my own mod and the Steerable Jetpack mod made by botman to get something that was flying and not too hard to control ^^
Finally, I was writing the mod description talking about bananas when I remembered that this fruit was available in the game actually :p So I decided to add one more easter egg to give people some bananas ;)
